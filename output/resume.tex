In this style, the resume starts with a blockquote, where you can
briefly list your specialties, or include a salient quote. Ending a line
with a backslash forces a line break.

{\bf Your Most Recent Work Experience:}

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained, lessons
learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and links:

\startitemize
\item
  First item
\item
  Item with \goto{link}[url(http://www.example.com)]. Links will work
  both in the html and pdf versions.
\stopitemize

{\bf That Other Job You Had}

Also with a short description.

\startsectionlevel[title={Technical
Experience},reference={technical-experience}]

\startdescription{My Cool Side Project}
  For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list
  can be used to have named items.

  \startitemize[packed]
  \item
    These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
    indentation levels in the markdown source.
  \item
    Second item.
  \stopitemize
\stopdescription

\startdescription{Open Source}
  List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the
  project names, for example the {\bf Linux Kernel}, where you
  implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or {\bf node.js} (with
  \goto{link}[url(http://nodejs.org)]) which was actually totally your
  idea\ldots{}
\stopdescription

\startdescription{Programming Languages}
  {\bf first-lang:} Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to
  add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention
  some others together at the end. A format that works well here is a
  description list where the first few items have their first word
  emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms.
  Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf version, which
  wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

  {\bf second-lang:} Description of your experience with second-lang,
  perhaps again including a {[}link{]}
  \goto{ref}[url(https://github.com/githubuser/superlongprojectname)],
  this time placing the url reference elsewhere in the document to
  reduce clutter (see source file).

  {\bf obscure-but-impressive-lang:} We both know this one's pushing it.

  Basic knowledge of {\bf C}, {\bf x86 assembly}, {\bf forth}, {\bf
  Common Lisp}

    English (native speaker)
