Harry Staley is a life-long learner with a love for data and the
democratization of information that has come to the world with the
advent of the Internet. His passion for technology began in 2004 with
the development of a database project during a summer internship while
working on his first Bachelor's Degree. Since that time, he has grown
that passion for technology and for how data fuels the engine of modern
innovations such as IDS, voice assistants, and autonomous vehicles.
Through his journey he has engaged in self-directed learning using tools
like MIT Open Courseware, Khan Academy, and Coursera to grow his toolkit
of skills and knowledge, and now gives back to others by teaching Python
and Cyber Security through Udacity and ThriveDX.

As part of Harry's vision for the democratization of information online,
he engages in community volunteer efforts working on open source
software, working with organizations like Code Alliance and Techtonica,
and mentoring students. For the last 12 years, Harry has applied his
skills in data science and data engineering to serve the public through
advancing the efficiency of US Army & DoD procurement systems.
