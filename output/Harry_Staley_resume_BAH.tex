I am a life-long learner with a love for data and the democratization of
information that has come to the world with the advent of the Internet.
My passion for technology began in 2004 with the development of a
database project during a summer internship while finishing my first
Bachelor's Degree. Since that time, I have grown that passion for
technology and for how data fuels the engine of modern innovations such
as IDS, voice assistants, and autonomous vehicles. Through this journey
I have engaged in self-directed learning using tools like MIT Open
Courseware, Khan Academy, and Coursera to grow my toolkit of knowlege,
skills and abilities. I give back to others by teaching Python and Cyber
Security through Udacity and ThriveDX.

As part of my vision for the democratization of information online, I
volunteer on open source software, working with organizations like
Benetech: Code Alliance and Techtonica, and mentoring students. For the
last 12 years, I have applied my data science and data engineering
skills to serve the public through advancing the efficiency of US Army &
DoD procurement systems and processes.
